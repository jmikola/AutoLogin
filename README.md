# AutoLogin

This library implements a Symfony2 security firewall listener to authenticate
users based on a single query parameter. This is useful for providing one-click
login functionality in email and newsletter links.

## Compatibility

This library's master branch maintains compatibility with Symfony2's master
branch. There is no alternate branch for 2.0.x compatibility.
